- Break up the !=, <= and >= into seperate bytecode
- Spit out bytecode for execution, removes need for parsing & lexing
  - With constant evaluation at compile-time
- Use Value::String(PTR) vs Value::String(STRING) and pointers when dealing with heap objects
- Use alternative allocator
- Remove clones in favour of borrowing
